## Challenges

1. The first challenge was understanding the use of custom-elements, Custom elements are very useful as the styling was done in the Js file. I found it diffcult to understand shadowDom and how to reach it in the earlier parts of the project.
2. It was difficult to keep the lines of code to a minimum, dom manipulation required me to create buttons and divs on the go.
3. Css, working with the shadowdom.
4. Drag & drop, Finish the project with in the time frame of 2 days. wasnt able to get it to fully work.
